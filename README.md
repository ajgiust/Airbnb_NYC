## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data for New York City from 2017-2019 to better understand:

1. Where are the best locations to book an Airbnb in NYC?
2. What are the most cost effective months to travel to NYC?
3. How far in advance should you brook your trip to NYC?
4. What Airbnb listing features most influence price?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The following are the files available in this repository:

* `Project - Write a Data Science Blog Post.ipynb` - a notebook of the analysis performed following the CRISP-DM process

* `calendar.csv` and `calendar_boston.csv` - csvs containing **home_id**, **date**, **availability**, and **price** for each home

* `listings.csv` and `listings_boston.csv` - these were not used for this particular analysis, but they were available from the original kaggle link


## Results <a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@giustino.anthony/4-things-you-should-know-before-booking-an-airbnb-in-new-york-city-419eceded481).
